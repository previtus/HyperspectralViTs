    <em>We introduce the HyperspectralViTs models and the OxHyper datasets of hyperspectral data from the NASA's EMIT sensor. We show that the proposed models outperform prior deep learning models in both score and processing speed. We test our models on low-compute hardware.

## HyperspectralViTs: General Hyperspectral Models for On-board Remote Sensing

<details>
  <summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>
  On-board processing of hyperspectral data with machine learning models would enable an unprecedented amount of autonomy across a wide range of tasks allowing new capabilities such as early warning systems and automated scheduling across constellations of satellites. However, current classical methods suffer from high false positive rates and therefore prevent easy automation while previously published deep learning models exhibit prohibitive computational requirements. We propose fast and accurate machine learning architectures which support endto-end processing of data with high spectral dimension without relying on hand-crafted products or spectral band compression techniques. We create three new large datasets of hyperspectral data containing all relevant spectral bands from the near global sensor EMIT. We evaluate our models on two tasks related to hyperspectral data processing - methane detection and mineral identification. Our models reach a new state-of-the-art performance on the task of methane detection, where we improve the F1 score of previous deep learning models by 27% on a newly created synthetic dataset and by 13% on the previously released large benchmark dataset. Our models generalise from synthetic datasets to data with real methane leak events and boost performance by 6.9% in F1 score in contrast with training models from scratch on the real data. Finally, with our newly proposed architectures, one capture from the EMIT sensor can be processed within 30 seconds on a realistic proxy of the IONSCV 004 satellite and in less than 0.64 seconds on a GPU powered Jetson AGX Xavier board.

### OxHyper datasets

In the paper we present three newly created OxHyper datasets with labels for 1.) <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/previtus/OxHyperRealCH4">real methane leak events</a>, 2.) <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/previtus/OxHyperSyntheticCH4">synthetic methane leak events</a> and 3.) dataset <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/previtus/OxHyperMinerals_Train">mineral identification</a>. In these, we provide wide range of hyperspectral bands from EMIT, computed methane enhancement products and also manually checked labels. We also use a new version of previously released STARCOP dataset of events from the AVIRIS-NG data, which can be collectively explored in <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/previtus/starcop-67f13cf30def71591f281a41">here</a>. For more details see the paper.

### Code examples

*WIP! I am currently working on preparing and cleaning this codebase (including some nice demo notebooks etc.)! If you are interested in using it and have some specific requests for demos, let me know! The datasets are all already public on HF and they have some initial data exploration demos.*
